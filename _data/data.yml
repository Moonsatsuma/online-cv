          - Developed a screen-printable tunnel junction for applications in double-side passivated contact solar cells, all-back-contact passivated contact solar cells and perovskite-Si tandem solar cell
          - Established various damage-free laser patterning processes for passivated contact solar cells
          - Established a methodology to accurately measure thickness and refractive indices of ultra-thin poly-Si layers
          - Quantified parasitic absorption in poly-Si layers and predicted efficiency potential for various novel solar cell architectures using realistically measured data
          - Supported and contributed to the development of the photovoltaic simulation platform xSolar-Hetero
          - Supported and contributed to analysing locally excited photoluminescence spread (by means of machine learning) to extract wafer-resistivity/emitter-sheet-resistance
